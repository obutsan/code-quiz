## Our Process

In this project work, we created three different levels with different design and approach, using react libraries and react bootstrap for design. 

It has a GitHub Explorer feature to find intersting repos based on the programmin language of your choice.

It has a Video Courses feature offering a collection of web and mobile development courses and tutorials from Internet Archive.

Meeting the bootcamp requirements we used more libraries (see listed below) and Supabase to store data that are displayed in leaderboard.
